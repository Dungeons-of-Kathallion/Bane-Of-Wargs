# Pull Requests
### Opening
1. Fixing issues

If you know how to adress an issue with a pull request, please do. However, I ask you to make sure you do some things: 1) Mention the issue; I will link the issue and pull request together, 2) TEST YOUR CODE! 3) Explain what your change does.

2. Your own idea

If you find a bug in the code and can quickly fix it, please create a pull request. It should be merged shortly, if you fix it correctly. If you have an addition to the code, there is a checklist for you to fill out. 1) TEST YOUR CODE! 2) Explain what your new code does and how it would be useful.
