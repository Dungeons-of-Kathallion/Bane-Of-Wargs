Bane Of Wargs is a python text-game engine with pre-built plots and the ability to create custom plugins/mods that completely change the game content. The game is very customizable and you will find many in-game features: equipment upgrading, items orders, mounts training over time, xp gaining, hp gaining, etc. This provides a very customizable and enjoyable python terminal-text based RPG.

You will have to fight monsters and bosses to get keys to unlock new areas on the map. The map is divided into points, determined by x and y coordinates, allowing maps up to 128x128 wide (so up to 16,384 places to explore), and more will be available as the engine progresses.

See the [Gameplay Guide](https://github.com/Dungeons-of-Kathallion/Bane-Of-Wargs/wiki/Gameplay-Guide) wiki page or check or the [Creating Mod](https://github.com/Dungeons-of-Kathallion/Bane-Of-Wargs/wiki/Creating-Mods) wiki page if you're interested in modding the game.

Here's the vanilla starting dialog plot:
> “
> You're a lumberjack who lives in a small village in the _Forlindon Woods_, a quiet and calm place to live. You've always wondered what's after this quiet forest; because your little village is a small town that lives apart from the other great cities in the _Stall Island_, _Kathallion Archipelago_. You've heard some stories and tales about the rest of the world. Only some words come to your mind when you hear "the world": dragons, gold, elves, dwarfs, great mountains, adventure...
>
> A day like others, you get a message in your mailbox: a dwarf king from the _Goro Mountains Peaks_ has heard from the mayor of the village, who keeps contact with him because they provide the village in stone, that you have great woodcraft skills. This dwarf king requests you to come to his castle in the mountains of the _Goro Peaks_ to participate to a great project...
>
> You decide to accept the deal, because of the great promised remuneration. You'll travel into many places like the _Californ Woods_, the _Stall Fields_, and many other great places.
> ”

## Installing The Game

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python source/main.py
```

**It's highly recommended to use a clean terminal with the ability to zoom in or out. It is also recommended to use fullscreen with a monospace font for the best gameplay experience.**
**Note that depending on your terminal, the colors will be limited. Find more about color systems [here](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/console.html#color-systems).**

_If you have any problems, check the full documentation on how to run the game from nothing at [`docs/PLAYING.MD`](https://github.com/Dungeons-of-Kathallion/Bane-Of-Wargs/blob/master/docs/PLAYING.md)._

## Building From Source

We recommend to build the game using the [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) program. You can use any if you like, but we only support PyInstaller.
